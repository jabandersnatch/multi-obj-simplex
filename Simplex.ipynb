    "\n",
    "The simplex algorithm is a method for solving linear programming problems. It was developed by George Dantzig in 1947. The simplex algorithm is an iterative procedure for finding the optimal solution to a linear programming problem. The simplex algorithm operates on a feasible solution to the problem, and moves from one feasible solution to another until the optimal solution is reached."

    "\n",
    "The simplex algorithm is used to solve linear programming problems. A linear programming problem is a mathematical optimization problem in which a linear objective function is maximized or minimized subject to a set of linear constraints. The simplex algorithm is used to solve linear programming problems in which the objective function and constraints are linear."
